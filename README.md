# CineMatch

Get personalized movie and TV show recommendations with the help of Google Gemini. This project was developed as part of the [Gemini API Developer Competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition).
## How is Gemini used in this project?
Our application uses the Gemini API to recommend movies based on an initial prompt provided by the user. This prompt can be of any type, including movie categories, actor names, awards, or any other parameter the user wishes. The Gemini API processes the prompt and curates a list of movies that best align with the given criteria.
## Other integrations
